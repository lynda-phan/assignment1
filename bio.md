Hello, my name is Lynda Phan.

I don't really have any hobbies. Weird, I know! I enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time with my fianc√© and French Bulldog Maximus. My interest includes listening to music, catching up on TV shows, and finding new places to eat in beautiful San Diego.

My favorite places to eat in San Diego includes Sushi Ota, Alexanders, Muzita, and Iron Side. Yum!

I feel really lucky to be living in San Diego. The weather is always nice and the people are friendly ... depending on where you go. :)

# Programming Background

I don't really have much of a programming background. I graduated from SDSU with a degree in Business Management and decided after a year of working that I wanted to be a Software Engineer. I dabbled with Python and Ruby for a few months and thought it would be a great industry to get into. So far, it has been difficult but extremely rewarding!

There were numerous projects in CS161/162 that gave me hands on experience and practice with programming. The one project that really caught my attention was "Game of Life". This was the first time I felt like I had to really sit down and plan ahead. I had to think outside the box, plan ahead, and be as detail oriented as possible in order to compete this project. The end result was very neat to look at and this was the first project I ever worked on that can be classified as a "game". Pretty darn cool!
