Hello, my name is Lynda Phan.

I don't really have any hobbies. Weird, I know! I enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time with my fianc√© and French Bulldog Maximus. My interest includes listening to music, catching up on TV shows, and finding new places to eat in beautiful San Diego.

# Programming Background

I don't really have much of a programming background. I graduated from SDSU with a degree in Business Management and decided after a year of working that I wanted to be a Software Engineer. I dabbled with Python and Ruby for a few months and thought it would be a great industry to get into. So far, it has been difficult but extremely rewarding!
