Hello, my name is Lynda Phan.

I don't really have any hobbies. Weird, I know! I enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time with my fianc√© and French Bulldog Maximus. My interest includes listening to music, catching up on TV shows, and finding new places to eat in beautiful San Diego.

My favorite places to eat in San Diego includes Sushi Ota, Alexanders, Muzita, and Iron Side. Yum!
